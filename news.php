        Due to University plans to demolish Noyes Hall, we will be moving our build room to Lafferre Hall! This move will give us much more space to work and make it easier to collaborate with other competition teams currently working there. From now on, meetings will be held in the basement of Lafferre next to MU Space Program.

        SURF meetings have started for the academic year. In response to covid, we will be using QR codes to keep track of attendance for contact tracing records, and we will have a dedicated computer in the build room for those who would like to attend virtually. In accordance with university policy, masks will be required in the build room. Though we were not able to participate in RoboSub this year, we will be continuing to work on our sub in preparation for RoboSub 2021!
